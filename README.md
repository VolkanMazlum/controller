This branch of the repository contains a simple controller made of only the planner, the feedforward part of the motor cortex and the brainstem.

Models of the neurons making up planner, feedforward motor cortex and brainstem are generated through NESTML. The module can be compiled by running:
`./nestml/generate_controller_module.py`
